\title{TimeMap.from.Dataframe}
\usage{
TimeMap.from.Dataframe(dframe, lag = 0, interpolation = splinefun)
}
\arguments{
\item{dframe}{A data frame containing exactly two columns: the first one is
interpreted as time}

\item{lag}{a scalar describing the time lag. Positive Values shift the
argument of the interpolation function forward in time. (retard its effect)}

\item{interpolation}{A function that returns a function the default is
splinefun. Other possible values are the linear interpolation approxfun or
any self made function with the same interface.}
}
\value{
An object of class TimeMap that contains the interpolation function
and the limits of the time range where the function is valid. Note that the
limits change according to the time lag this serves as a saveguard for Model
which thus can check that all involved functions of time are actually
defined for the times of interest
}
\description{
This function is a deprecated constructor of the class TimeMap.
