\arguments{
\item{t}{A vector containing the points in time where the solution is
sought.}

\item{ks}{A vector of length 7 containing the values of the exposure and
decomposition rates for each pool.}

\item{p}{A vector of containing transfer coefficients among different pools.}

\item{C0}{A vector containing the initial amount of carbon for the 7 pools.
The length of this vector must be 7.}

\item{In}{A vector of constant litter inputs.}

\item{xi}{A scalar or data.frame object specifying the external
(environmental and/or edaphic) effects on decomposition rates.}

\item{solver}{A function that solves the system of ODEs. This can be
\code{\link{euler}} or \code{\link{deSolve.lsoda.wrapper}} or any other user
provided function with the same interface.}

\item{pass}{if TRUE forces the constructor to create the model even if it is
invalid}
}
\value{
A Model Object that can be further queried
}
\description{
This function creates a model for seven pools as described in Liski et al.
(2005). Model not yet implemented due to lack of data in original
publication: values of vector p not completely described in paper. 0.1 was
assumed.
