\usage{
\S4method{getSolution}{Model_by_PoolNames}(object, params)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{object of class:\code{Model_by_PoolNames}, A modelrun as produced by the constructors: 
 \code{\link{Model}},
 \code{\link{Model_by_PoolNames}},
 \code{\link{Model_14}}
the function \code{\link{GeneralModel}} or the functions listed in 
\code{\link{predefinedModels}}. \cr
A model represents the initial value problem (IVP)  
for the contents of the pool consisting of 
\itemize{
 \item{ The initial values of the pool content}
 \item{ The system of ordinary differential equations, as dictated by the fluxes}
 \item{ The times for which the solution of the IVP is evaluated.}
}}

\item{params}{no manual documentation}
}
\value{
A matrix with as many columns as there are pools 
and as many rows as there are entries in the \code{times} argument the model has been build with.
