WarningConstFc<- function(){
            "The use of object of class SoilR.F0 is deprecated 
            At the moment we cast SoilR.Fo objects to the new class ConstFc
            which replaces it as input to this function.
            To get rid of this warning adapt your code to use CostFc in the first place. e.g replace SoilR.F0.new(some,args )  by ConstFC(same,args)"
