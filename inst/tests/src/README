Tests in this directory do not need the SoilR package to be installed 
This achieves greater test independence since the test here can be run
even if the package can not be installed.
They sometimes test functions that are not exported by SoilR namespace.
The tests contain information about the files they have to source 
before they can be run.
This makes it possible to test them without the need of integrating them## into the package.
